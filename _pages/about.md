# Guanlin Li

**PhD Researcher in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**  
**Lancaster University, UK**  
Supervised by [Hans Gellersen](https://www.gemini-erc.org/)

Welcome to my personal research website. My work bridge the gap between human physiology and immersive technology.

## Research Overview
I’m a PhD student focusing on **head‑mounted display (HMD) ergonomics**, **interaction techniques**, and **human–computer interaction**. My research explores how we can improve comfort, usability, and performance in immersive systems (VR/AR/MR) through better sensing and interaction design.

I graduated from **University College London (UCL)** in 2021 with an **MSc in Computer Science**. Before that, I obtained a Master's degree from the **University of Edinburgh** in **Power Electrical Engineering**.

## Primary Research Interests
- **HMD Ergonomics**: Improving long-term comfort in VR/AR headsets.
- **XR Interaction**: Designing novel head-pointing and gaze-based interaction techniques.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Understanding user behavior in immersive environments.
- **User Studies**: Conducting rigorous experimental designs to quantify performance.
- **Prototyping & Sensing**: Developing custom hardware and software for HCI research.

## News
- **[Feb 2025]** Our paper *"Quantifying neck muscle activity during head fixation in VR"* is out! Check it out in the Publications section.
- **[Jan 2025]** Excited to announce *"StrainGain amplifies head pointing"*!
- **[Aug 2024]** Successfully completed the summer user study on HMD ergonomics.
