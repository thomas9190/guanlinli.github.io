## [2026-02-19] - AI SEO & Blog Revival

### Added
- **YouTube Video Integration (Reusable)**:
    - Added CSS class `.video-container` for responsive 16:9 video embeds in `_sass/layout/_page.scss`.
    - Modified `_layouts/single.html` to automatically embed a YouTube player if `youtube_id` is present in front-matter.
    - Successfully embedded the YouTube video (Neck Muscle Activity) into the publication page: `2025-02-01-quantifying-neck-muscle-activity-during-head-fixation-in-vr.md`.
- **AI & LLM SEO Optimization**:
    - Created `_includes/ai-seo.html` for JSON-LD structure (Person & ScholarlyArticle).
    - Added Google Scholar meta tags (`citation_title`, `citation_author`, etc.) to publications.
    - Integrated AI-SEO into `_includes/head.html`.
- **Blog Functionality**:
    - Restored `_posts/` directory.
    - Added `_pages/blog.md` and updated `_data/navigation.yml` to include the blog.
    - Initial posts: `2026-02-19-hello-openclaw.md` and `2026-02-19-introducing-openclaw-the-new-cyber-steward.md`.
- **Changelog**: Initialized this `.maintenance_log.md` to track site improvements.

### Changed

    - Updated `description` with professional keywords.
    - Linked GitHub account and updated author bio.
    - Corrected site URL and repository paths.

    - Upgraded `_includes/ai-seo.html` to support multi-author JSON-LD and DOI meta tags.
    - Fetched and added actual abstracts from Frontiers and arXiv for better AI indexing.

## [2026-02-19] - StrainGain PDF Download Fix

### Fixed
- **Broken local PDF download for StrainGain publication**:
  - Root cause: `page.paperurl` was rendered as an absolute path without `baseurl`, so `/files/...` pointed to `https://thomas9190.github.io/files/...` instead of the project page path.
  - Implemented safe URL handling in `_layouts/single.html` by constructing `paper_href`, `slides_href`, and `bibtex_href` using `base_path = site.url + site.baseurl` for local assets while leaving full `https://` URLs untouched.
  - Removed a duplicate hand-written `[Download PDF]` link from `2025-01-01-StrainGain-amplifies-head-pointing.md` so the citation footer is the single source of truth.
  - Verified that the new “Download Paper” link correctly serves `files/Guanlin___IEEE_VR_Workshop__StrainGain_Head_cursor.pdf` on the live site.

## [2026-02-28] - Sidebar Overflow & Overlap Fix

### Fixed
- **Left sidebar causing overlap and inner scrollbar on desktop**:
  - Changed desktop sidebar behavior in `_sass/layout/_sidebar.scss` from `position: fixed` + `height: 100vh` + `overflow-y: auto` to `position: sticky` with `top: $masthead-height`.
  - Removed forced sidebar top padding in desktop mode (`padding-top: 0 !important`) to avoid excessive vertical spacing and reduce layout crowding.
  - Kept sidebar in normal layout flow so it no longer covers part of page content.
- **Sidebar visual density**:
  - Reduced avatar footprint by switching to responsive sizing (`max-width: 200px`, `aspect-ratio: 2/3`) and centered display.
  - Reduced author links font size from `$type-size-5` to `$type-size-6` to shorten sidebar height.
- **Blog page showing raw `<h2>` code block above posts**:
  - Root cause: year heading HTML in `_pages/blog.md` was emitted with leading markdown indentation, causing Jekyll/kramdown to render it as a code block.
  - Fix: removed leading indentation from Liquid loop output lines so `<h2 class="archive__subtitle">` renders as real HTML.
- **Favicon reliability for Google/Browser surfaces**:
  - Updated `_includes/head/custom.html` favicon tags to use `relative_url` paths (baseurl-safe), and added explicit `shortcut icon` + `.ico` entries.
  - Fixed `images/manifest.json` icon `src` values from absolute `/images/...` to relative paths so PWA/favicon metadata remains valid under project-site baseurl.
  - Added repository-root `favicon.ico` (copy of `images/favicon.ico`) so crawlers requesting default `/favicon.ico` on the project site can resolve it more reliably.
- **Google site-name signal strengthening**:
  - Added explicit `WebSite` JSON-LD (`name`, `alternateName`, `url`) in `_includes/ai-seo.html` to help Google identify the site as "Guanlin Li".
  - Added `application-name` and `apple-mobile-web-app-title` meta tags in `_includes/head/custom.html`.
  - Corrected Person schema `sameAs` ORCID value to avoid malformed URL (`{{ site.author.orcid }}` directly).
