    - Updated `description` with professional keywords.
    - Linked GitHub account and updated author bio.
    - Corrected site URL and repository paths.
- **Publication Metadata Enhancement**: 
    - Enriched all 2021-2025 publication markdown files with `authors`, `abstract`, and `doi` fields.
    - Upgraded `_includes/ai-seo.html` to support multi-author JSON-LD and DOI meta tags.
    - Fetched and added actual abstracts from Frontiers and arXiv for better AI indexing.

## [2026-02-19] - StrainGain PDF Download Fix

### Fixed
- **Broken local PDF download for StrainGain publication**:
  - Root cause: `page.paperurl` was rendered as an absolute path without `baseurl`, so `/files/...` pointed to `https://thomas9190.github.io/files/...` instead of the project page path.
  - Implemented safe URL handling in `_layouts/single.html` by constructing `paper_href`, `slides_href`, and `bibtex_href` using `base_path = site.url + site.baseurl` for local assets while leaving full `https://` URLs untouched.
  - Removed a duplicate hand-written `[Download PDF]` link from `2025-01-01-StrainGain-amplifies-head-pointing.md` so the citation footer is the single source of truth.
  - Verified that the new “Download Paper” link correctly serves `files/Guanlin___IEEE_VR_Workshop__StrainGain_Head_cursor.pdf` on the live site.
